# projectMoneyManagment

This application provides a simple Excel-like interface for tracking daily spending across five categories (Aâ€“E). Each day is shown on the left while the categories appear as columns at the top. The sum for the day and the remaining money are calculated automatically.

## Usage

Compile all Java files:

```bash
javac *.java
```

Run the graphical interface:

```bash
java MoneyTrackerGUI
```

Enter your total amount of money in the field at the top and use the **Add Day** button to add rows. Edit the category values directly in the table; the *Sum* and *Left* columns update whenever you change a value.

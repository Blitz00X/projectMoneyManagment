# projectMoneyManagment

This simple console program records daily spending across five categories (A-E).
For each day you enter the date and amounts spent in each category. The program
calculates the sum of those amounts and displays what is left from the total
money you specify at the beginning.

## Usage

Compile all Java files:

```
javac *.java
```

Run the program:

```
java Screen
```

Follow the prompts to enter your total money and daily amounts. When finished
entering days, type `done` as the date. A table similar to an Excel spreadsheet
will be printed with the totals and remaining balance for each day.
